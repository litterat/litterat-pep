/**

 * @formatter:off
 * 
 * The Pep library provides a way of categorising classes into one of the following:
 * 
 * atom - Primitive or accepts single argument to construct.
 * data - Has multiple values and tagged as data class.
 * class with data - a class that produces a data class.
 * array - 
 * class - A class that doesn't fit the previous three throw an exception.
 * 
 * It then provides the meta data and conversion functions for each category.
 * This can form the basis for different serialization and data structure
 * conversions. The mapper package provides examples of converting an Object to Object[]
 * and back as well as the same for Object to Map<String,Object>
